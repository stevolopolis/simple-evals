Defines function sonnet_errors(poem, target: str) -> Dict[str, Any]
which takes a target rhyme scheme (and optionally a list of required words) and returns a dict of errors

Returns an empty dictionary if there are no errors, so bool(sonnet_errors(poem, target)) is False if there are no
errors. It's a permissive check for sonnets errors, meaning that if it is unsure then it doesn't return an error.

Specifically, 

* Check if it adheres to a given rhyming scheme
* Check if each line has 10-11 syllables, more precisely, there's some pronounciation of each line with 10-11 syllalbes

This omits a few things like rhymes and iambic pentameter.

# Rhymes

For rhymes, we use python `pronouncing` library based on:

* CMU pronouncing dictionary http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict

# Syllable counting 

Given that there are multiple ways to pronounce many words (e.g. "caramel" can be pronounced with 2 or 3 syllables),
we adopt a "permissive" approach and consult multiple tools for syllable counting:

* pronounce - a well-known pronunciation dict based on from CMU's pronouncing dictionary 
* syllables - a Python library for syllable counting
* pyphen - a Python wrapper for the hyphenation library
